## 🌸 About Me
Hi, I’m Kanika — a Thai cybersecurity student currently pursuing B.Tech CSE (Cybersecurity) at the National Forensic Science University in India. I’m an ICCR Scholar with strong interests in **risk management, security monitoring, GRC, and cloud security**.

I enjoy building practical tools that protect real people, especially tools that reduce the impact of social engineering scams. I’m currently exploring **SIEM, threat intelligence, detection engineering, cloud security, and incident response**.

## 🤍 Philosophy
I believe cybersecurity should be **human-centered and accessible**.  
People don’t fall for scams because they are careless — they fall for them because threats are evolving faster than protections.  
So I focus on building tools that empower everyday users and make security clear, simple, and effective.
